uncompressed lightmap- when removed room became dark.

How long it took to complete the project-  6hrs total in a span of 2 days

One thing you liked about the project- I liked the fact that we can design our own room. I so wanted to make changes to the model aswell. But i know we need to start working on another tool to do that. I will start working on making my own models and develop a whole new world.

One thing that was particularly challenging about the project- the project is pretty straight foward. one small tricky thing is when adding trigger so that a click on the screen should change state. I added the script to globe but not to its parent. so unless i figured that i had to add it to the parent it did not work for me. 

Overall it was an amazing project! I cant wait to start doing more with unity. My goal number 1 is to make my own world and  player should be able to walk in the game and also touch things, drop things, carry things, etc.
